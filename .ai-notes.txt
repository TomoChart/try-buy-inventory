This commit sets up the initial scaffold for the YOUniversity Try & Buy Admin project. The frontend is built using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS, with pages for login, try & buy, devices, reports, BTL inventory, imports, and settings. The backend is set up using Express and Prisma, with stub routes for authentication, locations, devices, applications, loans, BTL, reports, GDPR, and imports. Both frontend and backend have their respective package.json and .env.example files configured.
