This commit sets up the initial scaffold for the YOUniversity Try & Buy Admin project. The frontend is built using Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS for styling, and includes basic pages and a sidebar component. The backend is an Express application with stub routes for the main functionalities. Both frontend and backend have their respective package.json and .env.example files for configuration.
