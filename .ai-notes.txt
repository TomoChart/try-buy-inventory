This initial scaffold sets up the basic structure for both the frontend and backend of the YOUniversity Try & Buy Admin project. The frontend uses Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS for styling, and includes a sidebar for navigation. The backend is built with Express and Prisma, with stub routes for each of the main functionalities. Environment variable examples are provided for both frontend and backend.
