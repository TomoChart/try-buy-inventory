## Galaxy Try HR Import

The Galaxy Try HR admin page supports importing data from a CSV/XLSX file.
Use the **Download template** button to generate a file with the required
columns:

```
submission_id, created_at, handover_at, imei, contacted, first_name, last_name,
email, phone, address, city, postal_code, pickup_city, days_left, model, note,
form_name
```

Populate this template and import it using the **Upload XLSX** or **Import CSV**
buttons. The importer expects this exact format.
